maia
======================
## About "maia"
This python module was created to make code clear and easy.
This page will be updated quite often, like the project itself, so I recommend checking for updates often

## Version 1.0
### AutoInstaller
That function will help you install packages without using a console command "pip install ..."\n
***Example***
'''python
<from maia import AutoInstaller>
'''
